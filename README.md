# 8x5-Mulit-Color-LED-Matrix-Display
8x5-Mulit-Color-LED-Matrix-Display-Images, Arduino.

I purchased this 8 x 5 LED Matrix Display, CSM-58261EG-21, several years ago (2017) and finally had the time to hook it up and make it work. The display has two LED's per "pixel" Red and Green and when both are enabled the color is Amber.
Arduino code was developed to drive the LED Matrix with minimal flicker (refresh rate <= 20ms) to show multi-color images on the display. Two images are displayed each time through the loop with one LED changing color in each image.

Parts: Arduino UNO, 10 390 Ohm resistors, 36 jumper wires, CSM-58261EG-21 Display, large bread board, small bread board.
